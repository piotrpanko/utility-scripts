1. yt-archiver

### yt-archiver
For most cases, **just use youtube-dl - it works great**. This is an oddly specific way to use youtube-dl - i wanted to downlaod specific videos that weren't on playlist etc. and i couldn't find a support for such case. And because i'm lazy, it was faster to write this couple lines than creating a playlist.
```shell
  ./yt-archiver.sh [path_to_txt_file_with_yt_links] [path_to_save_vids_locally]
```
